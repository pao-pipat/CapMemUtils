# CapMemUtils
 A collection of tools to analyse coarse-grained molecular dynamics (cgMD) trajectories involving (1) capsid, (2) receptor, and (3) membrane. All of this code in this reporitory has been used for analysing cgMD simulations of AAV2 capsid and AAVR in a model membrane.
## Datasets
Datasets are available here: TBA

This includes 10 $\mu s$ simulations of (1) AAV2-AAVR system, (2) AAV2-only system, (3) AAVR-only system, and (4) the solution state system. All waters and ions have been removed from the final xtc files for convenience in data handling.

Results from the analyses conducted as described in the paper are also available here: TBA

This includes all figure and compressed raw analysis outputs (in either .npy or .npz formats).
